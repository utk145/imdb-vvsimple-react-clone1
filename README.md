# IMDB Clone using React.js

This is a very simple front-end IMDB clone built with React JS. It uses `react-loading-skeleton`, `react-responsive-carousel`, and plain CSS for styling. The app has a skeleton loading effect and three sections for Popular, Top Rated, and Upcoming movies. It utilises [tmdb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) api for fetching information. 

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


Clone and setup the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    - git clone https://github.com/utk145/React-IMDB-Clone-easy.git
    - npm install --legacy-peer-deps
